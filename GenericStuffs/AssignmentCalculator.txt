Write a program to mimic basic calculator functionality – 
This program would be capable of taking input from the console/keyboard, 
process the data and output the result on the console.
The application must do the following operations:
Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication and be capable of finding remainder of any two numbers.
 
Key Learning points are:
Ability to demonstrate the knowledge of Java project and its sub modules like packages, source folder, classes and main methods.
Ability to demonstrate the use of input and output operations
Ability to demonstrate the use conditional statement in Java
No knowledge of Control statements is required at this point.
 


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Calculator {

public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    Maths Maths = new Maths();

    double answer = 0;
    double inputA, inputB;
    char operator;
    boolean done = false;

     while (done == false) {
        System.out.print("Please enter your sum: ");

        inputA = input.nextDouble();
        operator = input.next().charAt(0);
        inputB = input.nextDouble();        

        switch (operator) {
            case '+': answer = Maths.add(inputA, inputB);
                      break;
            case '-': answer = Maths.subtract(inputA, inputB);
                      break;
            case '*': answer = Maths.multiply(inputA, inputB);
                      break;
            case '/': answer = Maths.divide(inputA, inputB);
                      break;
            case '^': answer = Maths.power(inputA, inputB);
                      break;
        }

            System.out.println(answer);             
    }       

    input.close();

  }

}
And my second class...

public class Maths {

    double add(double a, double b) {
        double answer = a+b;
        return answer;          
    }

    double subtract(double a, double b) {
        double answer = a-b;
        return answer;          
    }

    double multiply(double a, double b) {
        double answer = a*b;
        return answer;          
    }

    double divide(double a, double b) {
        double answer = a/b;
        return answer;          
    }

    double power(double a, double b){
        double answer =a;

        for (int x=2; x<=b; x++){
            answer *= a;
        }

        return answer;
    }

}
